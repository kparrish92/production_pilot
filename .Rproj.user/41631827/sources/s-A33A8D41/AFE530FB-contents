Given a participant's L2 VOT, I want to predict their L3 VOT. L1 VOT and L2 proficiency will also be considered. 
The mean of each participant's VOT in the L2 and their VOT in the L3 will be analyzed in a multiples regression.


Outcome variable: 
L3 VOT

Predictors: 
factor (order of acquisition)
cont. L1 VOT
cont. L2 VOT
cont. L2 Proficiency 

L3 vot ~ L2 VOT + L1 VOT + order

If all participants use L2 boundaries, it would be expected to see a p-value of L2 VOT greater that .95, and for the p-value of L1 VOT to be less than .05.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}

es01 = read.csv("./tidy_data/es01.csv")
jennifer = read.csv("./tidy_data/jennifer.csv")

all = rbind(es01, jennifer)


```

```{r}

all %>% 
  select(language, mean, participant) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = language, values_from = mean) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes (x = french, y = spanish)) + geom_point()

```

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
